<!-- PURPOSE:    To declare the Parameter Entities (PEs) used to -->
<!-- over-ride the JATS DTD Suite default named, -->
<!-- general purpose mixes. (Mixes for particular -->
<!-- elements are declared in the Archive Custom -->
<!-- Models module.) -->
<!---->
<!-- Note: Since PEs must be declared before they -->
<!-- are used, this module must be called before the -->
<!-- default mixes modules (%default-mixes;) -->

<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- This DTD was created as a superset customization -->
<!-- of the ANSI/NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 Version 1.0 -->
<!-- Journal Article Tag Set. -->
<!---->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers may use the -->
<!-- DTD as is for markup of books or book-like -->
<!-- material for archiving and transferring -->
<!-- such material between archives or they may create -->
<!-- a custom XML DTD from the BITS Suite for -->
<!-- these purposes. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- modules to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the BITS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the Book Interchange Tag Suite (BITS). -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the Book Interchange Tag Suite -->
<!-- (BITS)." -->

<!--
  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
      =============================================================
       BITS Version 2.1                (DAL/BTU) v2.1  (2022-02-02)
       JATS Version 1.3                (DAL/BTU) v1.3  (2021-06-10)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.3 was approved in 2020, and BITS has been modified to use
       this most recent version. BITS requests approved by the BITS
       Working Group and selected changes from JATS were added to BITS
       to this BITS version 2.1.
  
    7. INSIDE TABLE CELLS - Added the following element to <td> and
       <th> and <oasis:entry>, using %inside-cell: 
          disp-quote | speech | statement | verse-group
  
  
    6. BITS became version "2.1" ("v2.1 20220202")
       Current JATS version is "1.3" and "v1.3 20220202"
  
      =============================================================
       BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-12-25)
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, and BITS modified to use
       the most recent version. No other changes to BITS were made.
  
    5. BITS remained version "2.0" but became "v2.0 20151225"
       JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
      =============================================================
       BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-03-15)
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-03-01)
  
       BITS was modified, based on user feedback collected in 2014 
       and January/February 2015, according to the decisions
       made by the BITS Working Group. This DTD represents current 
       BITS and an interim version of the non-normative JATS DTD 
       Suite (version 1.1), as an indication to JATS users of 
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee. 
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
    4. ANSWER-SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH-LEVEL OBJECTS
       Created a new PE (answer-para-level) to prohibit 
       <explanation> at the paragraph level inside
       <answer>, because that created DTD determinism problems.
  
    3. BOOK APPENDIX AND BOOK APPENDIX GROUP
       Changed the entity book-parts-mix to include the new
       book-level appendix and appendix group elements
       (<book-app> and <book-app.group>), so it WILL NOT LONGER
       contain the book-part-level appendices (<app> and
       <app-group>).
  
    2. BITS became version "2.0" and   "v2.0 20150630"
       JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       BITS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1    (2014-09-30)
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2  (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
    1. BITS became version "1.1" and   "v1.1 20140930//EN"
       JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

    Inline elements appear only inside a

    and lists may appear either within a
    paragraph or at the same level as a
    paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
    repository DTD, since some incoming material
    will have restricted such elements to only
    inside a paragraph,  some incoming material
    will have restricted them to only outside a
    paragraph and some may allow them in both
    places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
    be in either or both.
